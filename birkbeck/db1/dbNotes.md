# Introduction to Databases

## Resources and Articles

This is a really useful website, where you can test your `SQL` skills: [SQLJS](https://sqljs.org/). It allows to create tables on the fly and run `SQL `queries on them. Great learning tool!

A few introductory articles like the ones from [W.S.Vincent](https://wsvincent.com/database-design-tutorial-for-beginners/), as well as the classic one from [Paul Litwin](http://r937.com/Relational.HTML) of Microsoft SQL Team, written before 15 years but still applies today. Paul is today the Programming Core Manager of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

There is also this interesting tutorial from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/sql/Relational_Database_Design.html).

If you don't have enough time though (and need to submit that coursework), look no further than this course from [Audacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud197/)! A great and intuitive way to understanding basic databases. There's also this database [design](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/database-diagram/database-design) guide from Lucidchart. Need to go deeper?

- Design your [own](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~bknauff/dwebd/2004-02/DB-intro.pdf) database.
- A great introduction to [databases](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs145/) by Stanford University.
