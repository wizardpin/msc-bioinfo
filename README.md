# MSc Bioinformatics
This repository is going to host all the possible experiments for my Bioinformatics project, from my MSc in Birkbeck London University until the Coursera Bioinformatics and Rosalind courses.

The structure will be with folders and I am going to use Python, R and possibly Rust (is what I want to experiment with in the future).

For any questions or info feel free to email me!
