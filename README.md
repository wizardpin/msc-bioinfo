# MSc Bioinformatics and various courses
This repository is going to host all the possible experiments and code for all my Bioinformatics projects, namely:
* my MSc in Birkbeck London University
* General Assembly course in Data Science (DAT8) in Washington DC 2015
* the Coursera Bioinformatics
* Rosalind courses

The structure will be with folders and I am going to use Python, R and possibly Rust (is what I want to experiment with in the future).

For any questions or info feel free to email me!
