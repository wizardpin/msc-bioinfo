# Tools and Resources

Stephen J Eglen, a Cambridge professor in Neuroscience, is a big supported of reproducible research and code sharing in publications. Here's one of his [presentations](http://sje30.github.io/talks/2017/eglen-rdm.htm). Some tools that are used is [binder](https://mybinder.org/), a tool to turn a `GitHub` repo with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks into a `Docker` image.

Here's a great article from [C. Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-pof-software-archivability.html) talking about solutions to the reproducible research and code project (mostly because people use different software versions in different machines, which gives different results). One of those is CI or Continuous Integration (here's a [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/08/11/056473.full.pdf), describing that in detail).

Some Ideas about how you can use Open Data and Different events are here:

- Open Data Day [fun](http://opendataday.org/#resources)!
- Happened in [Cambridge](https://open-data-day-cambridge-2018.github.io/)
- Computational [Redistricting](http://redistrict.science/)
- Open [Companies](https://opencorporates.com/)

Here are the [three](https://eaves.ca/2009/11/29/three-laws-of-open-data-international-edition/) laws of Open Data.

Those should probably be in the `R` repository but until then:
